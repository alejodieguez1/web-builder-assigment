                    marketing company.</h2>
                <p id="info-p">One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability
                    to market your property to the right target audience. A professional agent with
                    the right experience will be able to identify who will be interested in your
                    property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their website,
                    paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who
                    has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of
                    marketing capabilities the company offers. Here is how:</p>

                      <h3 class="global-h3">Paid Advertising on All Channels</h3>
                      <p class="global-p">To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they
                        spend their time online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who
                        use luxury real estate marketing services are able to identify your niche
                        market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that
                        reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly
                        customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those
                        who are not in the market for a property such as yours.</p>

                  <div id="benefit-container">
                      <h3 class="global-h3">Expert Content Production</h3>
                      <p class="global-p">Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to
                          promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video
                          and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury
                          real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent
                          survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
                          video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with
                          potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use
                          video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be
                          like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult
                          to do with a written description. However, written descriptions—or
                          copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing
                          and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created
                          to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced
                          real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing
                          pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

                      <h3 class="global-h3">Effective Search Engine Optimization</h3>
                      <p class="global-p">Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they
                        purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that
                        they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to
                        show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the
                        right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is
                        referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and
                        correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts
                        at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that
                        match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide
                        opportunities for the buyer to learn more
                    </p>

                  <div id="benefit-container">
                      <h3 class="global-h3">Social Media Marketing</h3>
                      <p class="global-p">
                          If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access
                            to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an
                            influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to
                            social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service
                            providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent
                            his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social
                            media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an
                            agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in
                            their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they
                            can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than
                            their competitors.
